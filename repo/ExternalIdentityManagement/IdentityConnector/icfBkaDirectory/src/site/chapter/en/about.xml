  <title>About the Connector</title>
  <para>
    Identity Governance is a centralized identity management solution that provides self service, compliance, provisioning and password management services for applications residing on-premises or on the Cloud.
    Identity Governance connectors are used to integrate Identity Governance with external, identity-aware applications.

  <para>
    The Generic Directory Service connector lets you onboard LDAP directory server applications in Identity Governance.
    The various LDAP directory servers that this connector supports are

      In this guide, the connector that is deployed using the <emphasis role="strong">Applications</emphasis> option on the <emphasis role="strong">Applications Manage</emphasis> tab of Identity Self Service is referred to as an <emphasis role="strong">AOB application</emphasis>.
      The connector that is deployed using the <emphasis role="strong">Manage Connector</emphasis> option in Identity System Administration is referred to as a <emphasis role="strong">CI-based connector</emphasis> (Connector Installer-based connector).

  <para>
    From Identity Governance release 12.2.1.3.0 onward, connector deployment is handled using the application onboarding capability of Identity Self Service.
    This capability lets business users to onboard applications with minimum details and effort.
    The connector installation package includes a collection of predefined templates (XML files) that contain all the information required for provisioning and reconciling data from a given application or target system.
    These templates also include basic connectivity and configuration details specific to your target system.
    The connector uses information from these predefined templates allowing you to onboard your applications quickly and easily using only a single and simplified UI.
  </para>
  <para>
    <emphasis role="strong">Application onboarding</emphasis> is the process of registering or associating an application with Identity Governance and making that application available for provisioning and reconciliation of user information.

    <section xml:id="about-feature-recon-full">
      <title>Full and Incremental Reconciliation</title>
      <para>
        Full reconciliation involves reconciling all existing user records from the target system into Oracle Identity Governance.
        In incremental reconciliation, only records that are added or modified after the last reconciliation run are fetched into Oracle Identity Governance.
      </para>
      <para>
        After you create the application, you can perform full reconciliation to bring all existing user data from the target system to Oracle Identity Governance.
        After the first full reconciliation run, incremental reconciliation is automatically enabled.
        In incremental reconciliation, user accounts that have been added or modified since the last reconciliation run are fetched into Oracle Identity Governance.
      </para>
      <para>
        After you create the application, you can first perform full reconciliation.
        After the first full reconciliation run, incremental reconciliation is automatically enabled.

    <section xml:id="about-feature-recon-limited">
      <title>Limited Reconciliation</title>
      <para>
        You can set a reconciliation filter as the value of the Filter attribute of a reconciliation scheduled job.
        This filter specifies the subset of added and modified target system records that must be reconciled.
      </para>

    <section xml:id="about-feature-recon-deleted">
      <title>Reconciliation of Deleted User Records</title>
      <para>
        You can use the connector to reconcile user records that are deleted on the target system into Oracle Identity Governance.
      </para>
      <para>
        For more information about the reconciliation job used for reconciling these deleted records, see one of the following sections:

      <title>Support for the Connector Server</title>
      <para>
        Connector Server is one of the features provided by ICF.
        By using one or more connector servers, the connector architecture permits your application to communicate with externally deployed bundles.
      </para>
      <para>
        A Java connector server is useful when you do not wish to execute a Java connector bundle in the same VM as your application.
        It can be beneficial to run a Java connector on a different host for performance improvements.
      </para>

      <para>
        You can run pre and post action scripts on a computer where the
        connector is deployed. These scripts can be of type SQL/StoredProc/Groovy.
        You can configure the scripts to run before or after the create, update, or delete an account provisioning operations.

    <section xml:id="about-feature-connection-security">
      <title>Secure Communication to the Target System</title>
      <para>
        To provide secure communication to the target system, SSL is required.
        You can configure SSL between Oracle Identity Governance and the Connector Server and between the Connector Server and the target system.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you do not configure SSL, passwords can be transmitted over the network in clear text.
        For example, this problem can occur when you are creating a user or modifying a user's password.

    <section xml:id="about-feature-connection-pooling">
      <title>Connection Pooling</title>
      <para>
        A connection pool is a cache of objects that represent physical connections to the target.
        Oracle Identity Governance connectors can use these connections to communicate with target systems.
      </para>
      <para>
        At run time, the application requests a connection from the pool.
        If a connection is available, then the connector uses it and then returns it to the pool.
        A connection returned to the pool can again be requested for and used by the connector for another operation.
        By enabling the reuse of connections, the connection pool helps reduce connection creation overheads like network latency, memory allocation, and authentication.
      </para>
      <para>
        One connection pool is created for each set of basic configuration parameters that you provide while creating an application.
        For example, if you have three applications for three installations of the target system, then three connection pools will be created, one for each target system installation.
      </para>
      <para>
        For more information about the parameters that you can configure for connection pooling, see:

      <para>
        You can configure the connector for compatibility with high-availability target system environments.
      </para>
      <para>
        The connector can read information about backup target system hosts from the failover parameter of the Basic Configuration section and apply this information when it is unable to connect to the primary host
