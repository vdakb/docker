Requirement Definition
An approval workflow is required that allows a participant's employees to perform approvals for catalog items.
The special feature is that the catalog elements are generally accessible to all participants, but the affected beneficiaries are participant-specific.
The approvers must therefore also be integrated into the approval process on a participant-specific basis depending on the beneficiary.

Ultimately, this means that a role or a comparable construct that includes the approvers across all participants only considers the approvers who, based on their authorizations, are shown both the catalog element and the affected beneficiary.
In other words, it must be prevented that approvers are asked to make approvals in relation to beneficiaries for whom they are not responsible.

Constraints
Investigations into this topic have found that the approach of resolving a role or another adequate construct for configuring potential approvers via the Identity Governance plug-in points cannot achieve this, since the approvers cannot be passed on to the implementation of the approval process through a filter.

Design
To implement the requested feature, two components are required.
The actual SOA composite that implements the approval workflow.
An additional service, on the identity governance side, that provides the filtering algorithm.

Approval Process
The SOA composite is regularly instantiated using the workflow policies.
In the first step, the standard processes to be implemented are run through and than initiates the approval task.

Approval Task
The approval task should not allow to invite other participants in the approval workflow.
Task assignees needs to be populated dynamically invoking a dedicated service in Identity Governance that take over the responsiblitiry to filter out the applicable approvres.
