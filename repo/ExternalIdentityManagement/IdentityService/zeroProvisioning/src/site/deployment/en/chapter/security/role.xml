  <para>
    The application assumes group principal names to be:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist mark='bullet'>
    <listitem>
      <literal>zero_admin</literal>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <literal>zero_viewer</literal>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
    If the names differ from the naming convention used throughout OIM deployment the <emphasis role="strong">WEB-INF/weblogic.xml</emphasis> file needs to be modified accordingly and the application redeployed.
  </para>
  <para>
    The actual directory location for the groups should follow all IAM conventions in place, for the application only the <emphasis role="strong">group name</emphasis> (<literal>cn</literal> attribute) is important.
  </para>
