  <title>HTTP-Proxy Configuration</title>
  <para>
    For security reasons access to the services is proxied by a HTTP-WebServer deployed as a Reverse Proxy in the DMZ.
    The use of <emphasis>reverse</emphasis> originates in its counterpart <emphasis>forward</emphasis> proxy since the <emphasis>reverse</emphasis> proxy sits closer to the application server and serves only a restricted set of sites.
  </para>
  <para>
    Therefore this HTTP-WebServer needs to be configured to reroute the traffic through its server and deliver it to the application server.
