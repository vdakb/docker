  <para>
    By default, the access token provided by the client in the request (see <link linkend='use-authn'>Authentication</link>) is used to control access to requested resources.
    The Authorization Server?s access control policies are customizable, but in general, the scopes granted by the access token determine which resources and attributes are returned.
  </para>
  <para>
    If access controls determine that the client cannot access the requested resource, then a response with a <literal>403</literal> status code is returned.

  <para>
    A client may be allowed to access a resource but not all of its attributes.
    Clients should be prepared to receive incomplete resources, including resources stripped of attributes that are required by the schema.
