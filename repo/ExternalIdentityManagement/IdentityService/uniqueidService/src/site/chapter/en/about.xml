  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>
    For access to resources (applications, data) made available by the Police 20/20 program, the enhancement of the existing user IDs intended for this purpose with an additional P20/20 ID (hereinafter referred to as P20-UID) is described according to a uniform logic.
  </para>
  <para>
    This <emphasis>"Unique Identifier"</emphasis> (the P20-UID) is mapped in the Police Information Model (IMP).
    It is to be transmitted in the communication between the countries, the PSP / the Data Lake via the P20/20 interfaces.
    The P20-UID clearly identifies the responsible person for a query or a data change across all services.
    The P20-UID does not contain any personally identifiable data.
    An assignment to the person can only be made with the participation of the participant.
  </para>
  <para>
    The P20-UID is used for identification as well as for technical/data protection logging.
    Among other things, the country of origin, the (INPOL) participant or partner institutions that access P20/20 services should be directly derivable from it.
