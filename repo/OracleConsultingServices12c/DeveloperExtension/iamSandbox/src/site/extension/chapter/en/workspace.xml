        This structure allows working on several customer projects where the code repositories are not always on the same server.
        The framework itself is expecting this workspace structure mentioned in File System Structure for its own purpose.
        Therefore, you will find in the version control systems the same hierarchy.
      </para>
      <para>
        This was required to make it possible to handle to different code repositories that the framework has seen during its lifetime.
        Each of the folders checked in a Subversion Repository.
        It is not possible to point in a folder hierarchy to different code repositories (or better it is not useful to spread a hierarchy across different Subversion Repositories).

        If you do so, it will not be possible to tag or branch the development artifacts.
