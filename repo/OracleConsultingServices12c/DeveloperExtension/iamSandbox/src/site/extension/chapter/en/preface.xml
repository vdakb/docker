  <title>Preface</title>
  <para>
    This document embodies a unified set of standards to be used on IAM projects throughout Oracle Consulting.
    It addresses the core constructs and structures of the Java language, rather than application of the language (a set of guideline documents are being prepared for the major Java-related technologies within Oracle such as the ADF and IAM frameworks).
    The standards will be revisited and reissued regularly as they are adopted and exercised by new projects.
  </para>
  <para>
   The purpose of the guide is to provide comprehensive team member Orientation Guide to use during Project Kickoff and afterward for the on boarding of new team members.
   This will help to streamline the on-boarding process, ensure consistent communications and reduce the project manager and team leads workload during the on-boarding process.

    <title>Background</title>
    <para>
      Development of code on any project should be considered a team activity.
      Any individual developer does not own code, but will more likely evolve through successive iterations of design and build often being updated by several people.
      As a result, it is imperative that developers use guidelines to aid the development process.
