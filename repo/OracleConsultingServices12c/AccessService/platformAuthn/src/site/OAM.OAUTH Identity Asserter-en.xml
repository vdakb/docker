  <para>
    OAuth 2.0 leaves the design of access tokens in terms of encoding and validation up to implementers. These can be minted as JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
    https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519
  </para>
  <para>
    The Access Manager server, for example, can mint access tokens that are RSA-signed JWTs.
    These can be validated quickly and efficiently with the public key for the JWT. Cryptographic validation can be faster and more resilient than having identifier-based access which the resource server inspects by making a network query to the OAuth 2.0 server in order to retrieve the linked authorisation information.

  <title>JWT validation framework</title>
  <para>
    The JOSE+JWT library includes a simple framework to take care of the necessary steps to validate a JWT.
