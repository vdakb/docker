  <title>Authenticator Function with Oracle Access Manager</title>
  <para>
    This topic describes and illustrates use of the Authenticator configured to protect access to Web and non-Web resources with Oracle Access Manager.
  </para>
  <note>
    <para>
      Unless explicitly stated, information applies equally to Oracle Access Manager 12c and Oracle Access Manager 10g.

  </note>
  <para>
    The Authenticator function relies on Oracle Access Manager services to authenticate users who access applications deployed in WebLogic Server.
    Users are authenticated based on their credentials, such as a user name and password.
  </para>
  <para>
    When a user attempts to access a protected resource, the Oracle WebLogic Server challenges the user for credentials according to the authentication method specified in the application's web.xml file.
    Oracle WebLogic Server then invokes the Authentication Provider, which passes the credentials to Oracle Access Manager Access Server for validation through the enterprise directory server.
