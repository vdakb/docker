        Conversation over REST requires the e-Mail address of the developer.
        An e-mail address can change because people who are associated with such a term would like to often that an e-mail address reflects their current full name.

        It is quit unclear if agigee allows to chnage the e-Mail address of an registered developers.

        Any modifications made to developer portal users in Drupal will modify the developer in Googel Drupal, whether you are connecting to Google Drupal.
        The developer's email address is used as the identifier between the two systems.
        For example, if you edit a user in Drupal, the developer account in Google Drupal is updated to reflect those changes.
      </para>

    <section>
      <title>Problem</title>
      <para>
        However, if you modify developers in Google Drupal, those changes are not automatically reflected in the Drupal developer portal site.
