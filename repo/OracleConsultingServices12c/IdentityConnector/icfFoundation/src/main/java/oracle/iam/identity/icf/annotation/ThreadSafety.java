/**
 ** This annotation type may be used to indicate the level of thread safety for
 ** a class or method.
 ** <br>
 ** Any class or interface which does not include the <code>ThreadSafety</code>
 ** annotation should be assumed to be not threadsafe unless otherwise specified
 ** in the documentation for that class or interface.
 ** <p>
 ** If the <code>ThreadSafety</code> annotation is applied to a method, then it
 ** will override the class-level annotation for the scope of that method.
 ** <br>
 ** That is, if a class is declared to be
 ** <code>ThreadSafetyLevel.MOSTLY_NOT_THREADSAFE</code> but a method within
 ** that class is declared to be
 ** <code>ThreadSafetyLevel.METHOD_THREADSAFE</code>, then that method may be
 ** invoked concurrently by multiple threads against the same instance.
 ** <br>
 ** If a class is declared to be
 ** <code>ThreadSafetyLevel.MOSTLY_THREADSAFE</code> but a method within that
 ** class is declared to be
 ** <code>ThreadSafetyLevel.METHOD_NOT_THREADSAFE</code>, then that method must
 ** not be invoked on an instance while any other thread is attempting to access
 ** the same instance.
 ** <br>
 ** Methods within a class may only be annotated with either the
 ** <code>ThreadSafetyLevel.METHOD_THREADSAFE</code> or
 ** <code>ThreadSafetyLevel.METHOD_NOT_THREADSAFE</code> level, and only if the
 ** class is annotated with one of the
 ** <code>ThreadSafetyLevel.MOSTLY_THREADSAFE</code>,
 ** <code>ThreadSafetyLevel.MOSTLY_NOT_THREADSAFE</code>, or
 ** <code>ThreadSafetyLevel.INTERFACE_NOT_THREADSAFE</code> level.
 ** <br>
 ** Classes annotated with either the
 ** <code>ThreadSafetyLevel.COMPLETELY_THREADSAFE</code> or
 ** <code>ThreadSafetyLevel.NOT_THREADSAFE</code> levels must not provide
 ** alternate method-level <code>ThreadSafety</code> annotations.
 ** <br>
 ** Note that there are some caveats regarding thread safety and immutability of
 ** elements in the LDAP SDK that are true regardless of the stated thread
 ** safety level:
 ** <ul>
 **   <li>If an array is provided as an argument to a constructor or a method,
 **       then that array must not be referenced or altered by the caller at any
 **       time after that point unless it is clearly noted that it is acceptable
 **       to do so.
 **   <li>If an array is returned by a method, then the contents of that array
 **       must not be altered unless it is clearly noted that it is acceptable
 **       to do so.
 **   <li>If a method is intended to alter the state of an argument (e.g.,
 **       appending to a <code>StringBuilder</code> or <code>ByteBuffer</code>
 **       or <code>ByteStringBuffer</code>, reading from a <code>Reader</code>
 **       or an <code>InputStream</code>, or writing to a <code>Writer</code> or
 **       <code>OutputStream</code>), then that object provided as an argument
 **       must not be accessed by any other thread while that method is active
 **       unless it is clearly noted that it is acceptable to do so.
 **   <li>Unless otherwise noted, public static methods may be assumed to be
 **       threadsafe independent of the thread safety level for the class that
 ** </ul>
