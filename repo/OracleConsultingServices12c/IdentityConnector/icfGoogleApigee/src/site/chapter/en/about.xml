  <title>About the Google Apigee Edge Connector</title>
  <para>
    Oracle&#174; Identity Governance is a centralized identity management solution that provides self service, compliance, provisioning and password management services for applications residing on-premises or on the Cloud.
    Oracle&#174; Identity Governance connectors are used to integrate Oracle identity Governance with the external identity-aware applications.
  </para>
  <para>
    The Oracle&#174; Identity Manager Connector lets you create and onboard Google Apigee Edge applications in Oracle&#174; Identity Governance.

    <para>
      In this guide, the connector that is deployed using the <emphasis role="strong">Applications</emphasis> option on the <emphasis role="strong">Applications Manage</emphasis> tab of Identity Self Service is referred to as an <emphasis role="strong">AOB application</emphasis>.
      The connector that is deployed using the <emphasis role="strong">Manage Connector</emphasis> option in Identity System Administration is referred to as a <emphasis role="strong">CI-based connector</emphasis> (Connector Installer-based connector).
    </para>
  </note>
  <para>
    From Identity Governance release 12.2.1.3.0 onward, connector deployment is handled using the application onboarding capability of Identity Self Service.
    This capability lets business users to onboard applications with minimum details and effort.
    The connector installation package includes a collection of predefined templates (XML files) that contain all the information required for provisioning and reconciling data from a given application or target system.
    These templates also include basic connectivity and configuration details specific to your target system.
    The connector uses information from these predefined templates allowing you to onboard your applications quickly and easily using only a single and simplified UI.
  </para>
  <para>
    <emphasis role="strong">Application onboarding</emphasis> is the process of registering or associating an application with Identity Governance and making that application available for provisioning and reconciliation of user information.

    <title>Connector Architecture</title>
    <para>
      With the connector you can manage user and developer accounts on the target system.
      Account management is also known as target resource management.
      This mode of the connector enables the following operations:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="strong">Target Provisioning</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>
          Provisioning involves creating, updating, or deleting users on the target system through Oracle&#174; Identity Governance.
          When you allocate (or provision) a target system resource to an identity, the operation results in the creation of an account on the target system for that identity.
          In the Oracle&#174; Identity Governance context, the term "provisioning" is also used to mean updates (for example enabling or disabling) made to the target system account through Oracle&#174; Identity Governance.
        </para>
        <para>
          Before you can provision users to the required groups or rooms on the target system, you must fetch into Oracle&#174; Identity Governance the list of all groups and rooms used on the target system.
          This is achieved by using the OFS Group Lookup Reconciliation and OFS Room Lookup Reconciliation scheduled jobs for lookup synchronization.
          This is achieved by using the scheduled job for synchronizing lookups.
        </para>

          <emphasis role="strong">Target Reconciliation</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>
          During the target resource reconciliation, data on newly created and changed user accounts in the target system are compared and linked to existing identities and provisioned resources.
          To perform target resource reconciliation, scheduled job is used.
          The connector applies filters to locate users to be reconciled from the target system and then fetches the attribute values of these users.

    <para>
      As shown in this figure, Google Apigee Edge is configured as a target resource by Oracle&#174; Identity Governance.
      Provisioning, performed in Oracle&#174; Identity Governance, creates and updates accounts for identities on the target system.
      Through the reconciliation, account data that is created and updated directly on the target system is fetched in Oracle&#174; Identity Governance and saved against the corresponding identities.
    </para>
    <para>
      The Google Apigee Edge Connector is implemented by using the Identity Connector Framework (ICF).
      ICF is a component that is required to use Identity Connectors and provides basic reconciliation and provisioning operations that are common to all Identity Governance connectors.
      In addition, ICF offers general functions that developers would otherwise have to implement themselves, e.g. B. connection pooling, buffering, timeouts and filtering.
      The ICF is shipped along with Identity Governance.
      Therefore, you need not configure or modify the ICF.
    </para>

      The connector uses the REST Management API.

    <section xml:id="about-feature-recon-full">
      <title>Full and Incremental Reconciliation</title>
      <para>
        Full reconciliation involves reconciling all existing user records from the target system into Oracle&#174; Identity Governance.
        In incremental reconciliation, only records that are added or modified after the last reconciliation run are fetched into Oracle&#174; Identity Governance.
      </para>
      <para>
        After you create the application, you can perform full reconciliation to bring all existing user data from the target system to Oracle&#174; Identity Governance.
        After the first full reconciliation run, incremental reconciliation is automatically enabled.
        In incremental reconciliation, user accounts that have been added or modified since the last reconciliation run are fetched into Oracle&#174; Identity Governance.
      </para>
      <para>
        After you create the application, you can first perform full reconciliation.
        After the first full reconciliation run, incremental reconciliation is automatically enabled.

    <section xml:id="about-feature-recon-lookup">
      <title>Lookup Fields Synchronized with the Target System</title>
      <para>
        During a provisioning operation, you use a lookup field on the process form to specify a single value from a set of values.
        For example, you use the Country lookup field to select a country from the list of countries in the lookup field.
      </para>
      <para>
        When you deploy the connector, lookup definitions corresponding to the lookup fields on the target system are created in Oracle&#174; Identity Governance.
        Lookup field synchronization involves copying additions or changes made to the target system lookup fields into the lookup definitions in Oracle&#174; Identity Governance.
      </para>

      <title>Support for the Connector Server</title>
      <para>
        Connector Server is one of the features provided by ICF.
        By using one or more connector servers, the connector architecture permits your application to communicate with externally deployed bundles.
      </para>
      <para>
        A Java connector server is useful when you do not wish to execute a Java connector bundle in the same VM as your application.
        It can be beneficial to run a Java connector on a different host for performance improvements.

      <title>About global users</title>
      <para>
        All Edge users are called global users because they are created outside of any Edge organization.
        Once created, a global user can then be assigned to one or more organizations:

      </figure>
      <para>
        When you assign a user to an organization, you must specify the user's role in that organization.
        The user's role determines the actions that the user is allowed to perform in that organization.
        For example, some users are allowed to create APIs, while others can view APIs but cannot modify them.
      </para>
      <para>
        A global user can also be assigned to the role of Edge system administrator or Edge read-only system administrator.
        A system administrator performs all administrative tasks required to maintain Edge, including creating new global users.
