  <title>About the Connector</title>
  <para>
    Identity Manager automates access rights management, security, and provisioning of IT resources. Identity Manager connectors are used to integrate Identity Manager with external, identity-aware applications.
    This guide discusses the procedures to deploy and use the connector, which integrates Identity Manager with Atlasian Jira Server.
    The connector uses the REST Management API.

  <note>
    At some places in this guide, Atlasian Jira Server has been referred to as the target systems.
  </note>
  <para>
    In the account management (target resource) mode of the connector, information about users created or modified directly on the target system can be reconciled into Identity Manager. In addition, you can use Identity Manager to perform provisioning operations on the target system.
