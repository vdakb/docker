 ** This annotation type is used to indicate that instances of the associated

 ** <p>
 ** It will only be used for classes which are primarily used as data structures
 ** and will not be included in classes whose primary purpose is something other
 ** than as a data type.
 ** <br>
 ** It will also not be used for interfaces, abstract classes, or enums.
 ** <p>
 ** This annotation type will appear in the generated Javadoc documentation for
 ** classes and interfaces that include it.
