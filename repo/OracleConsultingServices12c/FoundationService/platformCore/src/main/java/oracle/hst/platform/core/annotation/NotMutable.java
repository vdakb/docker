/**
 ** This annotation type is used to indicate that instances of the associated
 ** class may not be altered after they have been created.  Note that this may
 ** or may not indicate strict immutability, as some classes marked with this
 ** annotation type may have their internal state altered in some way that is
 ** not externally visible.
 ** <br>
 ** In addition, the following caveats must be observed for classes containing
 ** this annotation type, and for all other classes in the framework:
 ** <ul>
 **   <li>If an array is provided as an argument to a constructor or a method,
 **       then that array must not be referenced or altered by the caller at any
 **       time after that point unless it is clearly noted that it is acceptable
 **       to do so.
 **   <li>If an array is returned by a method, then the contents of that array
 **       must not be altered unless it is clearly noted that it is acceptable
 **       to do so.
 ** </ul>
 ** It will only be used for classes which are primarily used as data structures
 ** and will not be included in classes whose primary purpose is something other
 ** than as a data type.
 ** <br>
 ** It will also not be used for interfaces, abstract classes, or enums.
 ** <p>
 ** This annotation type will appear in the generated Javadoc documentation for
 ** classes and interfaces that include it.
