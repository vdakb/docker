/**
 ** This class defines a Directory Server password storage scheme based on the
 ** 512-bit SHA-2 algorithm defined in FIPS 180-2.
 ** <p>
 ** This is a one-way digest algorithm so there is no way to retrieve the
 ** original clear-text version of the password from the hashed value (although
 ** this means that it is not suitable for things that need the clear-text
 ** password like DIGEST-MD5).
 ** <p>
 ** The values that it generates are also salted, which protects against
 ** dictionary attacks. It does this by generating a 64-bit random salt which is
 ** appended to the clear-text value.
 ** <br>
 ** A SHA-2 hash is then generated based on this, the salt is appended to the
 ** hash, and then the entire value is base64-encoded.
 ** Here are some example hashes (all of the password "Welcome1"):

 ** </pre>
 ** Using the secure random option, this class complies with the statistical
 ** random number generator tests specified in FIPS 140-2, Security
 ** Requirements for Cryptographic Modules, secition 4.9.1.
 ** <p>
 ** Comparing the hashes in "length-constant" time ensures that an attacker
 ** cannot extract the hash of a password in an on-line system using a timing
 ** attack, then crack it off-line.
 ** <p>
 ** The standard way to check if two sequences of bytes (strings) are the same
 ** is to compare the first byte, then the second, then the third, and so on. As
 ** soon as you find a byte that isn't the same for both strings, you know they
 ** are different and can return a negative response immediately. If you make it
 ** through both strings without finding any bytes that differ, you know the
 ** strings are the same and can return a positive result. This means that
 ** comparing two strings can take a different amount of time depending on how
 ** much of the strings match.
 ** <p>
 ** For example, a standard comparison of the strings "xyzabc" and "abcxyz"
 ** would immediately see that the first character is different and wouldn't
 ** bother to check the rest of the string. On the other hand, when the strings
 ** "aaaaaaaaaaB" and "aaaaaaaaaaZ" are compared, the comparison algorithm scans
 ** through the block of "a" before it determines the strings are unequal.
 ** <p>
 ** Suppose an attacker wants to break into an on-line system that rate limits
 ** authentication attempts to one attempt per second. Also suppose the attacker
 ** knows all of the parameters to the password hash (salt, hash type, etc),
 ** except for the hash and (obviously) the password. If the attacker can get a
 ** precise measurement of how long it takes the on-line system to compare the
 ** hash of the real password with the hash of a password the attacker provides,
 ** he can use the timing attack to extract part of the hash and crack it using
 ** an offline attack, bypassing the system's rate limiting.
 ** <p>
 ** First, the attacker finds 256 strings whose hashes begin with every possible
 ** byte. He sends each string to the on-line system, recording the amount of
 ** time it takes the system to respond. The string that takes the longest will
 ** be the one whose hash's first byte matches the real hash's first byte. The
 ** attacker now knows the first byte, and can continue the attack in a similar
 ** manner on the second byte, then the third, and so on. Once the attacker
 ** knows enough of the hash, he can use his own hardware to crack it, without
 ** being rate limited by the system.
 ** <p>
 ** It might seem like it would be impossible to run a timing attack over a
 ** network. However, it has been done, and has been
 ** <a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/ssl-timing.pdf">shown to be practical</a>.
