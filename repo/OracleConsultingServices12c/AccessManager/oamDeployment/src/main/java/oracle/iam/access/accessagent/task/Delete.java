/**
 ** Invokes the web-server registration servlet to delete
 ** <code>Access Agent</code>s in <i>Oracle Access Manager</i> (<b>OAM</b>).
 ** <p>
 ** A <code>Access Agent</code> is a web-server plug-in for <i>Oracle Access
 ** Manager</i> (<b>OAM</b>) that intercepts HTTP requests and forwards them to
 ** the <code>Access Server</code> for authentication and authorization.
 ** <p>
 ** <i>Oracle Access Manager</i> (<b>OAM</b>) authenticates each user with a
 ** customer-specified authentication method to determine the identity and
 ** leverages information stored in the user identity store. <i>Oracle Access
 ** Manager</i> (<b>OAM</b>) authentication supports several authentication
 ** methods and different authentication levels. Resources with varying degrees
 ** of sensitivity can be protected by requiring higher levels of authentication
 ** that correspond to more stringent authentication methods.
 ** <p>
 ** When a user tries to access a protected application, the request is received
 ** by <b>OAM</b> which checks for the existence of the <b>SSO</b> cookie.
 ** <p>
 ** After authenticating the user and setting up the user context and token,
 ** <b>OAM</b> sets the <b>SSO</b> cookie and encrypts the cookie with the
 ** SSO Server key (which can be decrypted only by the SSO Engine).
 ** <p>
 ** Depending on the actions (responses in OAM 11g) specified for authentication
 ** success and authentication failure, the user may be redirected to a specific
 ** URL, or user information might be passed on to other applications through a
 ** header variable or a cookie value.
 ** <p>
 ** Based on the authorization policy and results of the check, the user is
 ** allowed or denied access to the requested content. If the user is denied
 ** access, she is redirected to another URL (specified by the administrator in
 ** <code>Access Agent</code> registration).
